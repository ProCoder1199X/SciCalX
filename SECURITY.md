## Security Notes

- SciCalX is currently an Alpha product.
- The web version is **read-only** and does not collect or store any user data.
- The desktop version is **local only** and does not transmit data over the internet.
- Always download SciCalX only from the [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/ProCoder1199X/SciCalX/releases) page.

## Future Plans

- Regular security audits after Beta stage.
- Stronger Electron security practices (contextIsolation, sandbox, etc.) in upcoming versions.
- Option to submit anonymous vulnerability reports.
